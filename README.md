# megan-aics

Enhanced Style-GAN based training model which extends dataset by generating new variants without compromising quality of generation.

Combined encoders with styleGAN for quality generation for new images.


# Improvement using CONFUSION MATRIX

The below show comparison of normal real dataset vs mixed dataset (real+generated) both are trained compared using cnn.
